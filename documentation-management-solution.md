*The context of this writing sample is as follows: I am in charge of writing a proposal to stakeholders regarding a new Documentation Management System project.*

# Overview
Documentation plays a vital role in the efficiency, effectiveness, and overall success of a company. Therefore, our team is initiating the buildout of a world-class Documentation Management System (DMS) that we believe will positively impact our company’s journey towards the safer future we are creating.

An effective DMS needs to deliver documentation that is accessible, accurate, and agile:
- **Accessible**: Documentation needs to be easily accessible for all end users. The DMS must be capable of delivering various content types, such as text and video, through multiple device types, desktop and mobile, supporting multiple operating systems and networking environments. The DMS must do so, providing built-in accessibility features, to ensure people of all backgrounds, abilities, and languages are provided equal opportunity to benefit from our documentation.
- **Accurate**: Documentation must be accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive for all end users. The DMS must deliver accurate and comprehensive content, aligned with the fast-paced nature of the company. Also, the DMS must be capable of tracking active and expired information, along with setting review timelines of all content to ensure its ongoing accuracy.
- **Agile**: The DMS must be capable of creating, delivering, updating, and auditing documentation in a fast-paced environment. For example, the DMS must be easily trainable and user-friendly to new Technical Writers and other content contributors, allowing for rapid adoption and scalability. The processes, systems, and integrations that make up our DMS must be capable of customizations, enhancements, and integrations to support the company now and into the future.

# Our Approach
The Documentation Management System buildout will occur in five major phases:
- Phase 1: Identify a DMS Solution
- Phase 2: Build a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment
- Phase 3: Roll Out DMS Solution to a Pilot Group
- Phase 4: Roll Out DMS Solution Company-Wide
- Phase 5: Ongoing Long-Term Evolution of DMS

Within each phase, a comprehensive, cyclical approach will be followed, using the ADDIE model, a proven framework in Learning & Development environments.
1. **Analyze** opportunities, requirements, and goals of the current phase. This step requires collaboration and communication with key stakeholders, gathering all information needed to prepare a comprehensive plan.
2. **Design** a plan of action. This step involves the creation of flowcharts, processes, schedules, and tools that will be used to accomplish the goals of this phase.
3. **Develop** the systems, processes, and content that will be used to execute on the plan.
4. **Implement** the plan, utilizing everything that has been created, in collaboration with key stakeholders and contributors, to accomplish the phase’s goals.
5. **Evaluate** the work accomplished during the phase and assess if all goals were achieved.

The cyclical nature of ADDIE allows these five steps to be repeated until the phase’s goals are complete. ADDIE provides a well-structured, comprehensive, and agile approach to effectively and efficiently accomplish projects.
Documentation Management System Build Out Proposal

## Phase 1: Identify a DMS Solution
The goal of this phase is to identify and select a DMS solution that we will move forward with.
1. Analysis begins with looking at the current state of documentation within the company. What is currently being used? What works well and what doesn’t? How did the current solutions come to be? We will identify key stakeholders who should be involved with the selection and buildout of a DMS solution - this may include managers, Finance, Security and IT departments, Learning & Development teams, key content contributors, end-users, and more. We will meet to understand the requirements, features, and use-cases our DMS solution must satisfy, and we will generate excitement regarding how our solution will solve problems, elevate productivity, and assist in accomplishing their goals.
2. Taking these requirements, we will paint the picture of what our ideal DMS is. We will document requirements, build wireframes and visual mock-ups, develop process flowcharts, timelines, and more.
3. Next, we will begin a comprehensive investigation into potential DMS solutions, internal and external. We will begin meeting with DMS vendors, obtaining trial/public/free environments, with the goal of identifying which DMS solutions meet our requirements.
4. We will take potentially qualifying DMS solutions through thought-experiments, real-world scenarios, and more, testing DMS functionality and usability. We will meet with key stakeholders for input in order to ensure our DMS solution satisfies the needs of the entire company.
5. Lastly, we will evaluate our options and select the DMS solution that satisfies our requirements, provides the best functionality and usability, and overall excites us for what the future holds.

## Phase 2: Build a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment
The goal of this phase is to spin up a UAT environment that can be used to gain expertise of the DMS solution, build out the initial foundation of the DMS, and provide demos to key stakeholders.
1. We will meet with our selected DMS vendor and key stakeholders to determine what is required to develop our initial UAT environment, ensuring all infrastructural, security, and functionality requirements are met.
2. We will design Requirements Docs with all parties involved, putting together a timeline of the key milestones that must be met by each stakeholder in order to build our UAT environment. This may include Security sign-off, procurement needs, infrastructure buildout, vendor support, and more.
3. We will work with all parties involved to develop our UAT environment. Here, our team will work closely with key stakeholders, communicating and escalating questions, collaborating cross-functionally as needed, ensuring a streamlined and timely build out of our UAT environment.
4. Next, we will implement the UAT environment. Using real-world scenarios and use-cases, we will build out our UAT environment extensively. During this phase, our team will become the Subject Matter Experts of the DMS solution from the perspective of administrators, content contributors, and end users. We will begin creating documentation for those three groups, which will become the foundation of our overall DMS Manual.
5. We will meet with key stakeholders, providing demos of the DMS, receiving feedback for critical and non-critical requests, to overall evaluate the DMS UAT environment. This will be a pivotal time of celebration, as all of our hard work would be tangible for us to see!

## Phase 3: Roll Out DMS Solution to a Pilot Group
The goal of this phase is to identify a pilot group that can partner with our team to perform an initial roll out and provide further testing of the DMS solution.
1. We will look throughout our company, identifying an ideal pilot group to begin the initial roll out of our DMS solution. An ideal group is one that would greatly benefit from utilizing the DMS without slowing down any critical work they must deliver on in the short-term. Also, we will work with the DMS vendor, developing the PROD environment that will be used for this pilot roll out. By doing so, we will be able to continually iterate upon the UAT for further testing, enhancements, and upgrades, while also creating a stable PROD environment.
2. We will meet with the DMS vendor and key stakeholders of the pilot group, generating a plan of action, aligning on expectations, timelines, and requirements necessary to complete the pilot.
3. We will develop the PROD environment in collaboration with the DMS vendor. With our pilot group, we will develop feedback loops, channels of communication, additional documentation, and various project trackers to ensure a successful and timely pilot.
4. We will implement our PROD environment to our pilot group, providing expertise, guidance, support, and more.
5. Throughout the pilot, we will maintain frequent communication with our pilot group, receiving their feedback. We will also evaluate usage statistics and metrics gathered through our DMS to interpret usage, uptime, and overall effectiveness of our DMS. The information we gather during this phase will allow us to escalate additional feature requests to the DMS vendor, create better documentation for our DMS Manual, and ensure our DMS PROD environment is effectively where we want it to be.

## Phase 4: Roll Out DMS Solution Company-Wide
The goal of this phase is to gradually roll out the DMS solution company-wide. At this point, a blueprint for roll out will be in place through the prior phase and our DMS PROD environment will be complete for the company’s current needs.
1. We’ll begin by meeting with key stakeholders and department leads, demoing the DMS, providing updates on the pilot roll out, generating excitement and setting expectations regarding a company-wide DMS roll out. We will also meet with our DMS vendor, IT departments, Finance departments, and others, to ensure our DMS is fully supported regarding infrastructure, people,
and more, for a company-wide roll out.
2. In collaboration with department leads and key stakeholders, we will put together a roll out plan, tracking additional infrastructure work necessary to maintain a reliable DMS PROD environment and tracking the roll-out schedule for each department.
3. We will develop our DMS PROD environment further, ensuring the company-wide stability and support of our DMS solution. We will begin providing administrators, content contributors, and end users with documentation and training necessary to effectively use the DMS solution.
4. We will begin rolling out the DMS solution company-wide. This will be a very exciting time for us as we begin seeing how our DMS solution positively impacts the company, accomplishing the goals we dreamed of from the start.
5. Throughout this phase, we will utilize our built-in feedback loops and metric trackers to receive input, study data on usage and reliability, and find areas of improvement.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Long-Term Evolution of DMS
With the company-wide DMS solution roll out complete, our foundation is now in place. From here, we will continue to enhance our DMS, improving upon features, reliability, and more. Also, we will begin exploring integrations of our DMS into other systems and tools within the company.
1. We will continually analyze requirements, gathering feature requests, infrastructure needs, and assess how our DMS must evolve based on priorities, changes, and new projects within the company.
2. We will continually work with the DMS vendor and key stakeholders to improve upon our DMS by designing wireframes, mock-ups, flowcharts, and processes for version upgrades.
3. We’ll enhance our DMS by developing new features, integrations, UI changes, and more into our UAT environment. This UAT environment will continue to go through phase 1-5 to ensure reliability of our PROD environment. With each new critical integration, feature request, or version upgrade, we will test in UAT and pilot before rolling out company wide.
4. We will continue to implement version changes of our DMS, ensuring the long-term success and effectiveness of our DMS.
5. We will continue to utilize built-in feedback loops and metric trackers to receive input, study data on usage and reliability, and find areas of improvement.
